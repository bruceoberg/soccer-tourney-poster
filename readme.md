# Bruce's Soccer Tourney Poster Generator

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

This python script generates posters for the soccer tournements with group and elimination rounds. It shows all the matches, with spots to fill in scores. There are places to track group stage results. And the knockout stages have places to fill in the teams as they advance.

The initial iteration created posters for the 2022 world cup. Since the team/schedule data is read from an excel sheet, posters can be generated for other tournaments. Currently, the script creates posters for the 2023 women's world cup.

The generated posters are 27"x18" PDFs. The script can generate other paper sizes with appropriate bleed and cut marks. A typical scenario is to generate a cutmarked poster sized to 28"x22". This PDF can be remotely printed at many FedEx offices. If you email them, they will ususally cut at the marks so you can pick up the job at the correct paper size.
